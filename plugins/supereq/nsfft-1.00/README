NSFFT (Nonrestrictive SIMD FFT) is yet another FFT library for
performing 1-dimensional fast Fourier transforms. NSDFT is a simple,
small and portable library, and it is efficient since it can utilize
SIMD instruction sets in modern processors. It performs multiple
transforms simultaneously, and thus it is especially suitable for
digital signal processing. It does not need so much computation to
make a good execution plan. This library is in public domain, so that
you can incorporate this library into your product without any
obligation.
